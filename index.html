                    With the giant ocean of information and data around, a golden age has been 
                    created for black hat hackers. There are more than enough vulnerabilities to
                    exploit. Basic CySec knowledge is a must in this day and age

                <p>
                    The Name says it all. It's the practice of keeping a company or your
                    data safe from malicious attackers with harmfull intentions. Be it
                    hardware or software
                </p>
                <p>
                    As companies get bigger and bigger and generate more and more data,
                    cyber security has become mandatory. Hell yeah job security! Or is it

                    If proper systems are in place, attacked will have a hard time getting

                    Safety is only a feeling. If someone wants to get in, they will get in.
                    It's our main responsibility to implement systems, practices and incident
                    response plans.
                </p>

                    have to launch a counter attack!

                    The CIA is used as a core reference (The Three Pillars of Security) for 
                    protecting against unauthorised access, deletion and modification. All companies following
                    proper CySec regulations follow The Three Pillars. How long can a building stand
                    pillars for support.

                    Once a hacker is in, there's not much you can do. Pulling the cables always works
                    on the other hand... (seriously, don't ever do that...)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doing Risk Assessment is the staring point of understanding where the vulnerabilities are 
                    that a potential hacker could exploit.
